1.0 Brief Introduction
QS World University Rankings is an annual publication of global university rankings by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS). The QS ranking receives approval from the International Ranking Expert Group (IREG) and is viewed as one of the three most-widely read university rankings in the world. Hence, this project serves as a recommendation for students and parents to find the best university and information for universities to know their current ranking and to improve it in the future. 

2.0 Data Source
The data was obtained from Kaggle by Padhma Muniraj on QS World University Rankings from 2017 to 2022 (https://www.kaggle.com/code/padhmam/qs-world-university-rankings-eda-visualization/notebook). 
QS based its rankings to assess performance according to several key aspects of a university's mission: teaching, research, nurturing employability, and internationalisation. The methodological framework applied to assess the performance of education institutions are based on the following metrics:
i.	Academic Reputation (40%)
ii.	Employer Reputation (10%)
iii.	Faculty/Student Ratio (20%)
iv.	Citations per faculty (20%)
v.	International Faculty Ratio (5%)
vi.	International Student Ratio (5%)
Details on the methodology can be referred in here.

3.0 Dataset
The dataset is scrapped from the QR World Ranking website which consists of the following 15 attributes:
i.	university - name of the university
ii.	year - year of ranking
iii.	rank_display - rank given to the university
iv.	score - score of the university based on the six key metrics mentioned above
v.	link - link to the university profile page on QS website
vi.	country - country in which the university is located
vii.	city - city in which the university is located
viii.	region - continent in which the university is located
ix.	logo - link to the logo of the university
x.	type - type of university (public or private)
xi.	research_output - quality of research at the university
xii.	student_faculty_ratio - number of students assigned to per faculty
xiii.	international_students - number of international students enrolled at the university
xiv.	size - size of the university in terms of area
xv.	faculty_count - number of faculty or academic staff at the university

4.0 Data Transformation
Following are the steps for data transformation in QR World Ranking from 2017 to 2022 dataset:
1.	Loading the dataset
2.	Exploring the original dataset
3.	Dealing with missing data
4.	Data cleansing by removing unwanted attributes
5.	Converting character attributes as numerical
For more information on the data transformation, refer to our ui.R file.

5.0 Shiny Application Instruction
1.	The first sidebar consists of the following filters:
a.	University Ranking Based On Year
b.	Select Country of University 
2.	The tabs corresponding to the first side bar are:
a.	Data Overview:
Output: This displays the overview dataset for top 400 universities for each year.
b.	Student Faculty Ratio:
Output: This displays the histrogram of top 400 universities against itsâ€™ student faculty ratio.
c.	University Score:
Output: This displays the histrogram of top 400 universities against itsâ€™ score.
d.	Total of International Students:
Output: This displays the barchart of number of international students in Top 10 universities against Top 11 to 20 universities.
e.	Academic Research:
Output: This displays the correlation matrix of each attribute.
f.	Country Preferences:
Output: This displays the bargraph of the number of international students in each university.
g.	User Manual

3.	The second sidebar consists of the filter for Research Output.
4.	The third sidebar consists of a slider for World Rank ranging from 1 to 700.
